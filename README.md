## Configuration

You don't need to do anything if you are happy with the default colors and configuration of the calendar.

If you want to customize some of the aspects, create an initializer (ie: `config/initializer/decidim_calendar.rb`), paste the default configuration and modify according to your needs:


```ruby
Decidim::Calendar.configure do |config|
  # Colors per type of event
  # You can generate a nice color palette here: https://coolors.co
  # Just remove any event type that you don't want in your calendar
  config.events = {
    "Decidim::ParticipatoryProcessStep" => {
      color: "#3A4A9F",
      fontColor: "#fff", # used when "color" is used as background
      id: :participatory_step
    },
    "Decidim::Meetings::Meeting" => {
      color: "#ed1c24",
      fontColor: "#fff",
      id: :meeting
    },
    "Decidim::Calendar::ExternalEvent" => {
      color: "#ed650b",
      fontColor: "#fff",
      id: :external_event
    },
    "Decidim::Debates::Debate" => {
      color: "#099329",
      fontColor: "#fff",
      id: :debate
    },
    # optional events, it is save to define it here even if not installed (will be ignored)
    "Decidim::Consultation" => {
      color: "#92278f",
      fontColor: "#fff",
      id: :consultation
    }
  }

  config.calendar_options = {
    # 0 for sunday, 1 for monday, etc
    firstDay: 1,
    # one of: dayGridMonth,dayGridWeek,dayGridDay,listWeek,listMonth,list
    defaultView: "dayGridMonth",
    # use "true" to get a am/pm format
    hour12: false,
    # several of: dayGridMonth,dayGridWeek,dayGridDay,listWeek,listMonth,listYear
    views: "dayGridMonth,dayGridWeek,dayGridDay,listWeek",
    # Forces to open all event links in a new window
    openInNewWindow: true
  }
end
```

### Advanced configuration

You can also make use of your custom event models. For that you only need to ensure that these propoerties are returned by the module:

- `id`: the unique ID of the event
- `title`: the title of the event
- `start_date`: the start date of the event (can also be named `start_time`)
- `end_date`: the end date of the event (can also be named `end_time`)
- `subtitle`: (optional) the subtitle of the event
- `url`: (optional) the url of the event

By default the model is queried using the default scope of the model.
You can customized the amount of rows extracted by creating a new object and defining a `default_scope`:

```ruby
# /app/models/recent_meetings
class RecentMeetings < Decidim::Meetings::Meeting
  default_scope -> { where("start_time > ?", 1.years.ago) }

  # You can customize the title for instance
  def title
    "Recent Event: #{super}"
  end
end
```

Then, in your initializer:

```ruby
Decidim::Calendar.configure do |config|
  config.events = {
...,
    "RecentMeetings" => {
      color: "#ed1c24",
      fontColor: "#fff",
      id: :recent_meeting
    },
...
  }
end
```
